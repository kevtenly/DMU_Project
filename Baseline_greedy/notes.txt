1) Obstacle defined while solving HJB is 0.1m bigger than the actual obstacle.
This could be an issue since I am assuming min_safe_distance_from_obstacle as 0.0 in all the configs.
So, collision check in ESPOMDP is different from the collision check while solving the HJB.  

2) Thanks to the OrderedDict change Ben recommended in DESPOT, I can now replicate the results
from OMAK on my system as well. This is HUGE help with debugging issues in the experiment
pipeline output.
